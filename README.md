# docs_atwork

This repository contains knowledge gathered and prepared for you to consume.
We hope that it helps you understand the basics/methods of robotics required to participate in RoboCup@Work competitions.
You can find a lot of docs, files and links in this repository which we are trying to keep up-to-date as best as possible.

We are aware that some docs are in german language only. 
We suggest you using [DeepL](https://www.deepl.com/translator) to translate them to your preferred language.

We will NOT share our source code but are happy to answer your questions.
Robocup is about learning and understanding robotics, we don't want to hand out free shortcuts.
